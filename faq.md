# Wedding FAQ

## When is the big day?
We are celebrating the weekend of August 5th - 8th, 2027. The big day is Saturday, August 7th!

## What is the dress code?
The dress code is relaxed for most of the weekend. However, we ask that you dress up ("fancy") for the actual wedding day on August 7th.

## Are kids invited?
We love your little ones, but due to space restrictions, we have decided to keep our wedding and reception an adults-only event. We hope you understand and can still join us!

## Are gifts welcome?
Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift of all. However, we strictly request donations to our honeymoon fund instead of physical gifts.
